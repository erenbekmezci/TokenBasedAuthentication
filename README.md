# Token-Based Authentication Example with .NET

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement token-based authentication using .NET and IdentityServer. The goal is to provide a secure way for users to authenticate and access resources within a web application. This implementation will follow best practices for security and user management.


## About The Project

This project is designed to help developers understand how to implement token-based authentication in a .NET application using IdentityServer. Users will be able to register, log in, and obtain JWT tokens for accessing protected resources.
